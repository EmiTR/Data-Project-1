## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

About Markov Chain:
Using Markov chains allow us to switch from heuristic models to probabilistic ones. We can represent every customer journey (sequence of channels/touchpoints) as a chain in a directed Markov graph where each vertex is a possible state (channel/touchpoint) and the edges represent the probability of transition between the states (including conversion.) By computing the model and estimating transition probabilities we can attribute every channel/touchpoint.

Let's assume we have three customer journeys:

C1 -> C2 -> C3 -> purchase

C1 -> unsuccessful conversion

C2 -> C3 -> unsuccessful conversion

C1, C2, C3 (at different stages) - are called transition states, while the probability of moving from one channel to another channel is called transition probability.

To estimate the attribution of each channel/touchpoint, we will use removal effect. The main idea is:

if we obtain N conversions without a certain channel/touchpoint compared to total conversions T of the complete model, that means the channel reflects the change in total conversions (or value). After all, channels/touchpoints are estimated: we have to weight them because the total sum of (T - Ni) would be bigger than T and normally it is.

Another effective way to measure the Removal Effect is in percentages e.g. the channel affected conversion probabilities by X %.

P(Conversion after removing C1) = P(C2 -> C3 -> Convert)

2, Data

We have to prepare the data as input for Markov Chain. The optimal data sets contains of following columns: Customer_id, path, order_binary

Cutting CJ into sequences: 
C1 -> C4 -> C2 -> C3 -> conversion (first purchase) -> C2 -> C3 -> conversion (second purchase) -> C3 -> conversion (third purchase) -> C5.
We can split it like this:
a) C1 -> C4 -> C2 -> C3 -> conversion (first purchase),
b) C2 -> C3 -> conversion (second purchase),
c) C3 -> conversion (third purchase),
d) C5
```{r}
data_paths <- training_small %>%
 group_by(visitor_id) %>%
 mutate(path_no = ifelse(is.na(lag(cumsum(order_binary))), 0, lag(cumsum(order_binary))) + 1) %>%
 ungroup()
```

It makes sense to attribute paths of the first purchase and of the n-th purchase separately.
```{r}
data_paths_firstbuy <- data_paths %>%
 filter(path_no == 1) %>%
 select(-path_no)
```
It makes sense to replace or remove some channels when:
1) the marketing channel is unknown (no-campaign-cookie) due to variety of reasons
2) there is a specific channel in the path that we don't want to attribute such as Direct channel.
```{r}
data_paths_firstbuy <-data_paths_firstbuy %>%
  mutate(channel = ifelse(channel == 'no-campaign-cookie', NA, channel))
```
```{r}
# replace some channels - dir and NA (no-campaign-cookie)
data_firstbuy_clean <- data_paths_firstbuy %>%
 # removing NAs
 filter(!is.na(channel)) %>%
  
 # adding order of channels in the path
 group_by(visitor_id) %>%
 mutate(ord = c(1:n()),
 is_non_direct = ifelse(channel == 'dir', 0, 1),
 is_non_direct_cum = cumsum(is_non_direct)) %>%
  
 # removing Direct (channel_6) when it is the first in the path
 filter(is_non_direct_cum != 0) %>%
  
 # replacing Direct (channel_6) with the previous touch point
 mutate(channel = ifelse(channel == 'dir', channel[which(channel != 'dir')][is_non_direct_cum], channel)) %>%
  
 ungroup() %>%
 select(-ord, -is_non_direct, -is_non_direct_cum)
```

Removing one-channel path (dir-> conversion or seo -> conversion)
```{r}
#marking one-channel path with T or F
data_firstbuy_clean <- data_firstbuy_clean %>%
 group_by(visitor_id) %>%
 mutate(uniq_channel_tag = ifelse(length(unique(channel)) == 1, TRUE, FALSE)) %>%
 ungroup()
```
Then removing all the one-channel paths
```{r}
data_firstbuy_clean_multi <- data_firstbuy_clean %>%
 filter(uniq_channel_tag == FALSE) %>%
 select(-uniq_channel_tag)
```
```{r}
data_multi <- data_firstbuy_clean_multi %>%
 group_by(visitor_id) %>%
 summarise(path = paste(channel, collapse = ' > '),
 conversion = sum(order_binary),
 con_null = ifelse(conversion != 0, 0, 1)) %>%
 ungroup()
 
model1 <- markov_model(data_multi,
 var_path = 'path',
 var_conv = 'conversion',
 var_null = 'con_null',
 out_more = TRUE)
model1$removal_effects
model1$result
```

Now I'll do the same for multi conversions
```{r}
data_paths_repeatbuy <- data_paths %>%
 filter(path_no > 1) %>%
 select(-path_no)

data_paths_repeatbuy <-data_paths_repeatbuy %>%
  mutate(channel = ifelse(channel == 'no-campaign-cookie', NA, channel))
```
```{r}
# replace some channels - dir and NA (no-campaign-cookie)
data_repeatbuy_clean <- data_paths_repeatbuy %>%
 # removing NAs
 filter(!is.na(channel)) %>%
  
 # adding order of channels in the path
 group_by(visitor_id) %>%
 mutate(ord = c(1:n()),
 is_non_direct = ifelse(channel == 'dir', 0, 1),
 is_non_direct_cum = cumsum(is_non_direct)) %>%
  
 # removing Direct (channel_6) when it is the first in the path
 filter(is_non_direct_cum != 0) %>%
  
 # replacing Direct (channel_6) with the previous touch point
 mutate(channel = ifelse(channel == 'dir', channel[which(channel != 'dir')][is_non_direct_cum], channel)) %>%
  
 ungroup() %>%
 select(-ord, -is_non_direct, -is_non_direct_cum)
```

Removing one-channel path (dir-> conversion or seo -> conversion)
```{r}
#marking one-channel path with T or F
data_repeatbuy_clean <- data_repeatbuy_clean %>%
 group_by(visitor_id) %>%
 mutate(uniq_channel_tag = ifelse(length(unique(channel)) == 1, TRUE, FALSE)) %>%
 ungroup()
```
Then removing all the one-channel paths
```{r}
data_repeatbuy_clean_multi <- data_repeatbuy_clean %>%
 filter(uniq_channel_tag == FALSE) %>%
 select(-uniq_channel_tag)
```
```{r}
data_repeatbuy_multi <- data_repeatbuy_clean_multi %>%
 group_by(visitor_id) %>%
 summarise(path = paste(channel, collapse = ' > '),
 conversion = sum(order_binary),
 con_null = ifelse(conversion != 0, 0, 1)) %>%
 ungroup()
 
model2 <- markov_model(data_repeatbuy_multi,
 var_path = 'path',
 var_conv = 'conversion',
 var_null = 'con_null',
 out_more = TRUE)
model2$removal_effects
model2$result


```
