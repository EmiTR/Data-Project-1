## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
1, Packages

```{r}

library(dplyr)
library("RPostgreSQL")
library(magrittr)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(Amelia)
library(corrplot)
```


2, Data Input
Connection with the database
NO WAY I WILL PUBLISH IT :-P

Original data: onetable (27.504.638 rows)
Time: from 01.02-40.04.2018
```{sql connection=con}
select count(*) from rewe_web.onetable;
```

Sample data: 
```{sql connection=con}
create table company_web.onetable_sampleid as
select * 
from company.onetable tablesample BERNOULLI(10)
where visitor_id in (select distinct visitor_id from company.onetable);
```

3, Data preparation
3.1, Cleaning
*alread done
```{sql connection=con}
delete from company.onetable_sampleid where visit_binary like '0';
delete from company.onetable_sampleid where order_binary like '1' and revenue like '0';
delete from company.onetable_sampleid where pageview like '0' and visit_number like '1';
delete from company.onetable_sampleid where tracking_code like '';
```

Re-formating
*alread done
```{sql connection=con}
create table company.onetable_format as
select
  to_timestamp(daydate, 'Month DD,  YYY') AS daydate,
  visitor_id,
  visit_number::int,
  pageview::int,
  visit_binary::int,
  order_binary::int,
  order_id,
  revenue::numeric,
  split_part(tracking_code, '_', 1) AS channel,
  split_part(tracking_code, '_', 2) AS partner,
  visitor_id||visit_number||split_part(tracking_code, '_', 1) as visitchannel_id
from company.onetable_sampleid;
```

3.2, Exploring
Pull the table into R to do some quick summary 
```{r}
onetable_format <- dbReadTable(con, c("company","onetable_format"))
```
```{r}
summary(onetable_format)
```
```{sql connection=con}
select order_binary, count(*)
from company.onetable_format
group by order_binary;
```
```{sql connection=con}
select order_binary, channel, count(*)
from company.onetable_format
group by order_binary, channel
order by order_binary desc, count(*) desc;
```
```{sql connection=con}
select order_binary, pageview, count(*)
from company.onetable_format
group by order_binary, pageview
order by order_binary desc, count(*) desc;
```
```{sql connection=con}
select order_binary, visit_number, count(*)
from company.onetable_format
group by order_binary, visit_number
order by order_binary desc, count(*) desc;
```
```{sql connection=con}
select order_binary, partner, count(*)
from company.onetable_format
group by order_binary, partner
order by order_binary desc, count(*) desc;
```

3.3, Outliers killing

Definition of extrem values:
things that are > upper whisker =  Q_3 + 1.5 * IQR 
things that are < lower whisker = Q_1 - 1.5 * IQR
IQR = Q_3 - Q_1
```{sql connection=con}
delete from company.onetable_format where visit_number > (6 + 1.5*5);
```
```{sql connection=con}
delete from company.onetable_format where pageview > (4 + 1.5*3 + 50);
```
3.4 Visualising
Looking for missing values
```{r}
missmap(onetable_format, main = "Missing values vs observed")
```
```{r}
ggplot(data = onetable_format, aes(x=onetable_format$visit_number)) + geom_histogram()
```
```{r}
ggplot(data = onetable_format, aes(x=onetable_format$pageview)) + geom_histogram()
```
```{r}
ggplot(onetable_format, aes( x = factor(order_binary), y = visit_number)) + scale_y_log10() +   geom_boxplot()
```
```{r}
ggplot(onetable_format, aes( x = factor(order_binary), y = pageview)) + scale_y_log10() + geom_boxplot()
```

3.4 Transforming
Take a look back
```{sql connection=con}
select * from company.onetable_format limit 10;
```
building an other table for modeling. Actually I only wanna choose 4 main channal groups.

```{sql connection=con}
create table company.onetable_model as
select 
  daydate,
  visitor_id,
  visit_number,
  pageview,
  order_binary,
  revenue, 
  channel,
  CASE WHEN channel = 'aff' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS aff,
  CASE WHEN channel = 'crm' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS crm,
  CASE WHEN channel = 'dim' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS dim,
  CASE WHEN channel = 'dir' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS dir,
  CASE WHEN channel = 'ref' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS ref,
  CASE WHEN channel = 'sea' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS sea,
  CASE WHEN channel = 'seo' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS seo,
  CASE WHEN channel = 'int' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS int_ch,
  CASE WHEN channel = 'pla' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS pla,
  CASE WHEN channel = 'som' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS som
from company.onetable_format;
```

```{sql connection=con}
select * from company.onetable_model limit 10;
```
```{sql connection=con}
select visitor_id,sum()  from company.onetable_model;
```
*0207 nhung doan sau nay la do lam viec o nha

```{r}
onetable_training1 <- dbReadTable(con, c("company","onetable_training1"))
```
```{r}
onetable_test1 <- dbReadTable(con, c("company","onetable_test1"))
```

3.5 Splitting data set
create table company.onetable_sampleid as
select * 
from company.onetable tablesample BERNOULLI(10)
where visitor_id in (select distinct visitor_id from rewe_web.onetable);
```{sql connection=con}
create table company.onetable_training1 as
select * 
from company.onetable_model tablesample BERNOULLI(75)
where visitor_id in (select distinct visitor_id from company.onetable_model);
```
```{sql connection=con}
create table company.onetable_test1 as
select * 
from company.onetable_model 
where visitor_id in (select distinct visitor_id from company.onetable_model) and visitor_id not in (select distinct visitor_id from company.onetable_training1) ;
```
cac buoc tiep theo:
```{r}
onetable_test1%>%arrange(visitor_id,visit_number)
```
To-do: count distinct visitor_id, count distinct visitor id who bought
```{sql connection=con}
select count(distinct visitor_id) from company.onetable_training1;
```
```{sql connection=con}
select count(distinct visitor_id) from company.onetable_training1 where order_binary = 1;
```
```{sql connection=con}
select visitor_id, sum(order_binary) from company.onetable_training1 where order_binary = 1 group by visitor_id order by sum(order_binary) desc;
```

4, Modeling

neu factor(visitor_id) thi sao? Test
model <- glm(order_binary~.- daydate + factor(visitor_id) - channel, data = onetable_training1, family = "binomial")
```{r}
model <- glm(order_binary~.- daydate + factor(visitor_id) - channel, data = onetable_training1, family = "binomial")
```
```{r}
augment(model)
```
```{r}
exp(coef(model))
```
```{r}
augment(model, type.predict = "response")
```
why...
```{r}
augment(model, newdata = onetable_test1, type.predict = "response")
```
