# Data-Project-1
Data Projects from 201
I want to know more about data and how to work/have funs with them so I have started learning Python and Co. at the end of 2019. I found like 1000 online courses and tutors and have been practicing and learning since then. Now what I need the most is someone to give me feedbacks and orientations. So..
Wanna give me some feedbacks? ;-D
