## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

The idea of LR attribution is to classify the customers/visitors to converted and not-converted classes based on their channel interactions. Estimate the credit distribused based on the model's coefficients.

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
1, Packages
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(magrittr)
```
2, Data
we need at least dataset with visitor_id, channel, count des Touch with channel, visit_number, order_binary and path of conversions

```{r}
data_path_LR <- training_small %>%
 group_by(visitor_id, visit_number) %>%
 mutate(path_no = ifelse(is.na(lag(cumsum(order_binary))), 0, lag(cumsum(order_binary))) + 1) %>%
 select(- partner, - revenue)
```
```{r}
data_path_LR <- data_path_LR %>%
 mutate(dummy_sea = ifelse(channel == 'sea', 1, 0),
        dummy_crm = ifelse(channel == 'crm', 1, 0),
        dummy_ref = ifelse(channel == 'ref', 1, 0),
        dummy_seo = ifelse(channel == 'seo', 1, 0),
        dummy_aff = ifelse(channel == 'aff', 1, 0),
        dummy_som = ifelse(channel == 'som', 1, 0),
        dummy_int = ifelse(channel == 'int', 1, 0),
        dummy_ret = ifelse(channel == 'ret', 1, 0),
        dummy_dim = ifelse(channel == 'dim', 1, 0),
        dummy_ooh = ifelse(channel == 'ooh', 1, 0),
        dummy_pla = ifelse(channel == 'pla', 1, 0),
        dummy_app = ifelse(channel == 'app', 1, 0),
        dummy_cop = ifelse(channel == 'cop', 1, 0),
        dummy_pos = ifelse(channel == 'pos', 1, 0),
        dummy_et  = ifelse(channel == 'et', 1, 0),
        dummy_red = ifelse(channel == 'red', 1, 0),
        dummy_hzl = ifelse(channel == 'ref', 1, 0)
        ) #here there is a need to identify the channels automatically and use a loop to creat this dataset. 
```
now we have to cut CJ in to consequences
```{r}
data_path_LR%>%
  group_by(visitor_id, path_no)%>%
  summarise(count_visit = n(),
            average_pageview = (sum(pageview)/n()),
            order_binary = sum(order_binary)
            )
```
```{r}
data_LR <- data_path_LR%>%
  group_by(visitor_id, path_no)%>%
  summarise(count_visit = n(),
            average_pageview = (sum(pageview)/n()),
            order_binary = ifelse(sum(order_binary) > 0, 1, 0),
            sum_sea = sum(dummy_sea),
            sum_crm = sum(dummy_crm),
            sum_ref = sum(dummy_ref),
            sum_seo = sum(dummy_seo),
            sum_aff = sum(dummy_aff),
            sum_som = sum(dummy_som),
            sum_int = sum(dummy_int),
            sum_ret = sum(dummy_ret),
            sum_dim = sum(dummy_dim),
            sum_ooh = sum(dummy_ooh),
            sum_pla = sum(dummy_pla),
            sum_app = sum(dummy_app),
            sum_cop = sum(dummy_cop),
            sum_pos = sum(dummy_pos),
            sum_et = sum(dummy_et),
            sum_red = sum(dummy_red),
            sum_hzl = sum(dummy_hzl))
```
```{r}
LR_model <- glm(order_binary~ . - average_pageview - visitor_id - path_no, family = binomial, data = data_LR)
```
```{r}
summary(LR_model)
```
Problem: there too many path with null conversions! there are to many channels with no conversion and mini visits.
Lösung: group channels? do it with null_con and conveterd?
```{r}
augment(LR_model)
```
```{r}
exp(coef(LR_model))
```
